        <div class="leftRightContainer">
            <div class="vision-left">
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey I'm Sehan Munir, a grade 11 MaCS student at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute 🦁🏫.
                    I’m running for 🍏 TDSB Student Senate LC1 Communication 💬 Officer 👮 because I genuinely 
                    believe good communication can change everything—especially for students like us. With 
                    lots of hands-on experience making promotional materials 📢 such as posters, graphics, logos, videos, and 
                    announcements, I know how to get a message across in a way that’s clear, creative, 
                    and actually engaging 👍. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A lot of students 🧑‍🎓 feel disconnected from the opportunities the TDSB offers—and
                    honestly, I get it. Most of us have no idea what we want to do in the future ⏳, and 
                    sometimes all it takes is seeing the right opportunity at the right time. As the
                    Communication Officer👮💬, I’ll work hard to bridge that gap between the board and 
                    students. I’ll make sure opportunities are not just available, but visible. Whether 
                    it’s a program, event, contest, or resource, I’ll bring it into the spotlight so
                    more students can take advantage and take action.

            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <p>
            My journey has led me through a wide range of interests—from technology and design to communication and sports—and each experience has helped me grow into a creative thinker, a strong collaborator, and a passionate leader. <br><br>
            At my school, I’ve played a key role in building and shaping communities. One of my proudest accomplishments has been helping grow our Robotics Club from a brand-new initiative into one of the largest and most active clubs. Along the way, I’ve taken the lead in everything from organizing events and managing outreach to designing our showcase website and visual identity.
            I’ve also created posters, graphics, logos, and announcements for several other school groups, including the Cubing Club, Robotics Team, and Athletic Council. Whether it’s a club event or a school-wide campaign, I love using design and storytelling to get people excited, informed, and involved. <br><br>
            Outside of school, I am a website developer hackathon team called DuploHacks, where I helped design and develop a clean, user-focused website to highlight our vision and projects. Through every experience, I’ve learned the power of clear communication, strong teamwork, and thoughtful design—and I’m always eager to keep learning, building, and connecting.
